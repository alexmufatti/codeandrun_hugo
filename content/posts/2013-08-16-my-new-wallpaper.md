Here is my new desktop wallpaper (and current blog header), one of the best shot I’ve taken during my MTB trips.

![image](/images/2021/08/20130704_195307_hub69c966cc377ee0ce97d6c58a4b6169d_277376_700x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)

Wallpaper Crocione!

It was taken [here](https://www.google.it/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d3265!2d8.6702513!3d45.9207276!2m1!1e3&fid=7) on Cuvignone pass and, on the background, you can see (from left to right): lake Varese, lake Monate and lake Maggiore.

I think it’s worth a visit!
